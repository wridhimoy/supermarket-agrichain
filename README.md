# Supermarket Checkout

# Checkout System

This project implements a supermarket checkout process that calculates the total price of items added to the cart by the customer. It follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and includes test cases for the checkout functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone https://github.com/your-username/checkout-system.git


Copy code

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd checkout-system


Copy code

## Usage

1. To run the checkout system, open a Python interpreter or a Python script file and create an instance of the `Checkout` class:

```python
from checkout import Checkout

checkout = Checkout()
Add items to the cart by calling the add_item method with the item code:
python


Copy code
checkout.add_item('A')
checkout.add_item('B')
checkout.add_item('C')
Calculate the total price by calling the calculate_total method:
python


Copy code
total_price = checkout.calculate_total()
print(f"Total price: {total_price}")
Testing
This project includes unit tests for the checkout functionality. To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:


Copy code
python -m unittest tests/test_checkout.py

This implementation follows the OOP principles by separating concerns into different classes. The `Checkout` class handles the cart and calculates the total price, while the `Pricing` class manages the item prices and offers, and calculates the discounted prices.

The `tests/test_checkout.py` file contains unit tests for the `Checkout` class, covering different scenarios like an empty cart, single item, multiple items, discounted items, and mixed items.

The `README.md` file provides instructions for installation, usage, testing, and contributing to the project.
